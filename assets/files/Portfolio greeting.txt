Hi, I'm Tom. I have learned so much in my time at Eleven Fifty Academy and am very anxious to begin my new career in Web Development. I want to develop applications that are visually appealing and beneficial to the end user and the organization.  I am equally comfortable programming both front and back end web modules working on teams towards a common goal.  Please look around and share any ideas or comments you have in the contact area.
